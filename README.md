#  Netflix Data Analysis using SQL

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset using SQL. It answers insightful business questions about content trends, genres, countries, durations, and cast/directors by writing and executing well-structured SQL queries.

## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
**Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Objectives
The project aims to:
- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- pgAdmin or any SQL environment
- Basic knowledge of RDBMS and data analysis

##  Key SQL Concepts Used
- SELECT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
- DISTINCT, COUNT, RANK, AVG
- CASE, WITH (CTE), EXTRACT, TO_DATE
- String functions: TRIM(), UNNEST(), STRING_TO_ARRAY(), SPLIT_PART(), ILIKE, POSITION(), SUBSTRING()
